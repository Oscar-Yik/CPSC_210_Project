# My Personal Project

## Introduction

For this project, I want to make a manic shooter game with pixelated graphics and dynamic 
movement capabilities. I am personally a huge fan of these types of games such as *Soul Knight*,
*Realm of the Mad God*, *Vampire Survivors*, and many others. Through this class project, 
I would like to put my programming skills to the test to make something that is entertaining 
for me and hopefully other people as well. My goal for this game is to create a short 20-30 minute 
fast-paced entertaining experience for anyone who has a few minutes to spare.

## Specifications

The game will revolve around a playable character in the middle of the screen who will 
journey around a fantasy world hunting monsters. After achieving the objective, the game will reset
back to the title screen and need to be replayed. However, every replay of the game will increase 
the size of the world map, increase the difficulty of the enemies, and randomize the map entirely. 
In addition to these features, each replay will allow the character to change or upgrade their 
equipment to prepare them for the next leg of the journey. This data will be stored as a save state
and allow the user to continue their adventure when they want to play again. After the user completes
the game, they will be able to continually replay the game with the enemies increasing in quantity and 
difficulty infinitely (adding arbitrary number of "**X**" enemies to the world "**Y**"). 
Increasing the character's level will correspond to increasing the character's attributes and abilities 
in various ways. The exact implementation and detail of these features may vary as time is limited.
